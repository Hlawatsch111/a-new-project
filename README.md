# a-new-project

Your idea in a nutshell: AI meal planner - A manager of planning dinner meals - who will participate, what are everyone's favourite dishes and find a common meal depending on who is participating
Background: There is always a stress when planning a dinner, depending on creativity, time issues and co-ordinating everyones schedule. In a family this is a recurrent problem. Solving the issue would make life so much easier and all family members happy
Data and AI techniques: The input would be every family members grading of a basket of different receipes, but also their interest in trying something new. We would need an app that registers all family members desires and likings, some kind of database to save the data of every unique member but also receipes, a link to personal calendars would be optional. Would need linear regression, in a later stage machine learning where the computer may suggest receipes depending on particiapting individuals  
How is it used: All family members. Some family members would think this is unnecessary as food is just supposed to be served and to their liking.
Challenges: It would not solve short term stress, such as quick other activities that need to be done, which would off-set this planning tool. It does not either solve the shopping part, as the refrigerator needs to be filled with ingredients ahead of time. 
What next: It could become a well appreciated family tool for many other families as well
Acknowledgments: No programming since I am not at that stage of knowledge, yet

##Summary -
